My goals for 2026 

2026 Launch & Fundraising Master Plan — Umut & Nova

Purpose: Get investment‑ready, polish the product suite, incorporate a nonprofit in 2026, and publish a cohesive Adil‑ecosystem (AdilStore, Social platform, Decentralized Internet, AdilOS, +). This doc is a living plan we will iterate weekly.

⸻

0) North Star

Vision: A fair, open, privacy‑first ecosystem where users own their content, identity, and time.
Mission (1‑liner): Ship humane infrastructure and apps that let people build, earn, and belong — without ads, surveillance, or lock‑in.
Tagline: Adil: Technology with conscience.

Core principles: Privacy by default • Open protocols • Local‑first • Community governance • Ethical AI • No dark patterns.

⸻

1) Product Suite (2026 scope)
	•	AdilStore — fair app store for web/PWA/Flutter apps; dev‑friendly distribution; revenue share transparent; permission scoring.
	•	BenefiSocial (working name) — social/helping platform; offers/requests/gifts; AI‑assisted matching; groups & voting.
	•	AdilNet (Decentralized Internet layer) — DAG + IPFS‑style content; wallet/alias; pinning as social resilience.
	•	TimeCoin — earn/spend via meaningful actions (post‑MVP sandbox economy; compliance‑aware).
	•	AdilOS — open, device‑respecting Android layer; local agent framework; telemetry off by default.

Demo criteria: Each product must pass a 90‑sec live demo with offline mode, privacy policy, and a basic threat model.

⸻

2) 12‑Month Roadmap (Oct 2025 → Oct 2026)

Phase A — Polish & Proof (Oct–Dec ’25)
	•	Freeze scope to 3 MVP pillars: AdilStore, Social (MVP), AdilNet (content publish/read).
	•	Ship Privacy Policy v1 + Terms v1 across all properties; implement telemetry opt‑in.
	•	Publish public roadmap & ethics page; start monthly dev logs.

Phase B — Nonprofit & Pilot (Jan–Apr ’26)
	•	Incorporate Adil Foundation (US) and file EIN; prepare 1023 package (or fiscal sponsorship fallback).
	•	Pilot cohorts: 200–500 early users; seed 50 creators on AdilStore.
	•	Release Social MVP + group voting + alias usernames (non‑custodial).

Phase C — Community & Grants (May–Jul ’26)
	•	Foundation site + donation/grant pages; publish governance charter draft.
	•	Open‑source core repos with LICENSE + CONTRIBUTING + security policy.
	•	First community call + quarterly townhall; launch contributor program.

Phase D — Fundraise & Launch (Aug–Oct ’26)
	•	Investor deck + 5‑min video demo; soft‑circle champions.
	•	Public launch week: AdilStore + Social + AdilNet toolkit; PR + dev‑rel push.
	•	Close initial funding (grants + angels/impact) for 18‑month runway.

⸻

3) Sprint Cadence (repeatable)
	•	6‑week build → 2‑week hardening → demo day.
	•	Each sprint ends with: live demo video, CHANGELOG, metrics post, security review notes.

Sprint exit checklist:
	•	Crash‑free rate ≥ 98% (last 7 days)
	•	P50/P95 latency within budget
	•	Privacy review: only strictly‑needed data; toggles verified
	•	Threat model updated; top 3 risks mitigated
	•	Docs: README, Quickstart, API reference updated

⸻

4) Incorporation & Structure (high‑level, non‑legal)

Option A: Dual entity (Mozilla‑style)
	•	Adil Foundation — 501(c)(3) public benefit: research, open protocols, education, grants, stewardship of trademarks.
	•	Adil Labs PBC — steward‑owned Public Benefit Corporation: services, enterprise support, paid hosting; revenue funds the mission.

Option B: Nonprofit only (donations & grants). Watch for UBIT on commercial revenue.

Option C: Coop/Steward‑owned (for workers & community).

Fast start: Consider fiscal sponsorship for 6–12 months to accept tax‑deductible donations while 1023 processes.

Nonprofit (U.S.) formation steps (summary):
	1.	Choose state (CA Nonprofit Public Benefit Corp or DE Nonstock) → file Articles.
	2.	Draft Bylaws + Conflict of Interest policy.
	3.	Get EIN (IRS) → open bank account.
	4.	File IRS Form 1023/1023‑EZ (c)(3) determination.
	5.	Register for state charity compliance.

(This is informational; consult counsel/CPA.)

⸻

5) Governance & Ethics
	•	Constitution: privacy by default; user data ownership; open APIs; zero‑ads/zero‑surveillance; transparent moderation.
	•	Board (foundation): 3–5 members; independence > 51%; term limits.
	•	Community governance: RFCs, on‑chain/off‑chain voting for non‑security decisions; code of conduct; transparency report quarterly.

⸻

6) Legal/Policy Foundations (templates to prepare)
	•	Privacy Policy (plain‑language + detailed)
	•	Terms of Use (no vendor lock‑in; export/delete data easily)
	•	Security Policy (vuln disclosure; response SLA)
	•	Contributor License Agreement (CLA) or DCO
	•	Trademark policy (fair use; brand protection without capture)
	•	License choices per repo (e.g., Apache‑2/MIT for libs; AGPL for server if desired)

⸻

7) Pitch Deck Outline (12 slides)
	1.	Title & Mission
	2.	Problem (platform lock‑in, surveillance, creator squeeze)
	3.	Why Now (AI shift, dWeb maturity, policy wind, user fatigue)
	4.	Solution = Adil Stack (Store + Social + Net + OS)
	5.	Product Demos (90‑sec each; offline + privacy)
	6.	Tech & Moat (local‑first, DAG/IPFS, agent framework, ethics built‑in)
	7.	Community & Governance (foundation + contributor flywheel)
	8.	Traction (pilot metrics, contributors, LOIs)
	9.	Model (services, marketplace rev‑share, sponsorships)
	10.	Impact & Ethics (no ads, no dark patterns; research/education)
	11.	Roadmap & Use of Funds (18‑month plan)
	12.	Team & The Ask (round size, runway, milestones)

5‑min demo video: show “Create → Publish → Own” across Store/Social/Net.

8) Metrics & Proof (pre‑seed friendly)

Product: WAU/MAU, D30 retention, session length, crash‑free %, P95 latency.
Community: GitHub stars, PRs merged/month, active contributors, RFC votes.
Market: Creator waitlist (#), LOIs/MOUs, pilot orgs, newsletter subs, NPS.
Impact: % opt‑in telemetry, privacy audits passed, content pinned redundancy.

Target by Launch (Oct ’26):
	•	5k MAU across products; 200 creators; 50 active contributors; 2 university/NGO pilots; 1 public audit.

⸻

9) Data Room Checklist (lite → full)
